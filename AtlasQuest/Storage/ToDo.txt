Stuff I Want to Do:

- Rename QuestIDs file to QuestData file

- Move  PreQuest & FQuest icon markers to QuestData.  Info that is the same between translations should be stored in a separate file to reduce file size and workload for translators.

- Make a new Icon or Marker or something for Class-specific quests, Heroic, Mythic, etc?  I don't really like using paranthesis. 




Quests To Add:
 
 - Vault of the Wardens: Startup Sequence
 - Vault of the Wardens: More Than Just A Food Vendor
 - Vault of the Wardens: The Enemy of My Enemy...
 - Vault of the Wardens: Unleashing Judgment
 
 - Emerald Nightmare: Piercing the Veil
 
 - Neltharion's Lair: Misdirected
