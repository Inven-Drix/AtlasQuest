Stuff I Want to Do:

- Rename QuestIDs file to QuestData file

- Move  PreQuest & FQuest icon markers to QuestData.  Info that is the same between translations should be stored in a separate file to reduce file size and workload for translators.

- Make a new Icon or Marker or something for Class-specific quests, Heroic, Mythic, etc?  I don't really like using paranthesis.

- Emerald Nightmare: Ysondre's Call
- Emerald Nightmare: Ysondre's Farewell

Trial of the Crusader: Hides of Legend
